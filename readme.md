This repo is designed to use NameousChangey's [LifeBoatAPI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NameousChangey.lifeboatapi) vscode extension.  
`_build/_buildactions.lua` will be run when building this project using the above extension.  

You will need to modify `Lua.workspace.library` in `.vscode/settings.json` to the correct paths.  
You will also need [AvrilsTransportAddonMCs](https://github.com/dude112113/AvrilsTransportAddonMCs) along side the folder of this repo.
